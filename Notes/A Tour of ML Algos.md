Two ways to categorize ML algorithms:
1. Learning style
2. similarity in form or function

## Grouping by Learning Style
1. Supervised Learning: Known labels or results are loaded with the training data. 
	1. EX: Spam emails, stock prices at a time
	2. The model is prepared through a training process in which it is required to make predictions and is corrected when the predictions are wrong.
	3. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.
	4. EX: Classification and regression
2. Unsupervised Learning: Input data is not labeled and does not have a known result
	1. A model is prepared be deducing structures present in the input data. This may be to extract general rules. It may be to organize data by similarity.
	2. EX: Clustering, conditionality reduction, and association rule learning.
	3. EX: K-means
3. Semi-Supervised Learning: Input data is a mixture of trained and untrained data with and without labels.
	1. There is a desired prediction problem but the model must learn the structure to organize the data as well as make predictions.
	2. EX: Classification and regression
	3. EX: Algorithms are extensions to other flexible methods that make assumptions about how to model the unlabeled data.
